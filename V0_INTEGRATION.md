# V0 Integration Guide for Salud Language Learning Platform

This guide explains how to connect the Salud Language Learning Platform (Next.js version) to V0 for enhanced UI generation and design capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Vercel CLI installed (`npm install -g vercel`)
- A GitHub repository for your project
- A V0 account (https://v0.dev/)

## Files for V0 Integration

The following files have been created to facilitate V0 integration:

1. **v0.json**: Configuration file for V0 that specifies project settings
2. **v0-metadata.json**: Generated metadata about components and pages
3. **v0-integration.js**: Script to generate metadata for V0
4. **deploy-to-vercel.js**: Script to deploy to Vercel and connect to V0

## Integration Steps

### 1. Generate V0 Metadata

Run the V0 integration script to generate metadata about your components and pages:

```bash
node v0-integration.js
```

This will create a `v0-metadata.json` file that contains information about your project's components and pages.

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

Deploy your Next.js application to Vercel using the deployment script:

```bash
node deploy-to-vercel.js
```

This script will:
- Check if Vercel CLI is installed
- Verify that all required configuration files exist
- Deploy your application to Vercel
- Provide instructions for connecting to V0

### 3. Connect to V0

After deploying to Vercel, follow these steps to connect your project to V0:

1. Go to https://v0.dev/ and create a new project
2. Name your project (e.g., "salud-language-learning")
3. Link your GitHub repository
4. In the V0 dashboard, configure the project to use the v0.json configuration
5. Deploy your project from the V0 dashboard

## Using V0 for UI Generation

Once your project is connected to V0, you can use it to:

1. Generate new UI components based on your existing design system
2. Enhance existing components with AI-powered suggestions
3. Create variations of your components for different use cases
4. Export generated components directly to your codebase

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the V0 integration:

1. Ensure all configuration files (v0.json, vercel.json) are correctly formatted
2. Verify that your GitHub repository is properly linked to both Vercel and V0
3. Check that your Next.js application is correctly structured
4. Make sure your components follow best practices for React and Next.js
